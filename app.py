    Explain chord progressions in musical terms:

    Example:
    Input: C G Am F
    Output: This is a very common pop progression (I窶天窶砺i窶的V in C major). It creates a sense of familiarity and resolution, often used in ballads and anthems.

    Example:
    Input: D G A
    Output: This is a I窶的V窶天 progression in D major, one of the most basic and powerful patterns in Western music. It creates strong tension and resolution, great for rock or folk.
